RRD Merger is a perl script that merges 2 RRDs into a new one.

It takes care of pushing out all old rows in favor of the new ones. It also 
does a basic data checking to make sure that it is manipulating consistent 
round robin bases.

Being written in Perl it needs the following libraries to be installed:

   XML::Twig
   Getopt::Long
   Term::ReadKey
   RRDs

You can get them all on CPAN except for RRDs, which is part of the
rrdtool distribution.  Also the script has been tested on Perl 5.8 and
Linux (FC1). I expect it NOT to work on Windows boxes (I could test it,
but I am too lazy. Beside, you all know Linux is far much better at this
kinda stuff ;) )

Please be aware that I currently build the whole XML table in memory. This
in turn it means that it is slow and wants plenty of memory! A tipical RRD
with just Average and Max data which is dumped on 500Kb XML files, results in 
about 15Mb memory usage by Perl and it takes just over 40 seconds to complete 
on a AMD Duron 700 (talk about recycling with Linux! :) )

     Usage: rrdmerger.pl  --oldrrd=<file.rrd> --newrrd=<file.rrd>
                          [--mergedrrd=<file.rrd>] [--tmppath=<directory>]
     
     Options:
       --oldrrd=file.rrd      : old RRD file to merge with new one
       --newrrd=file.rrd      : new RRD file to merge with old one
       --mergedrrd=file.rrd   : resulting file. If not specified will take the
                                name of the new file with added a timestamp
       --tmppath=directory    : directory where to store temporary files.
                                Default --> /tmp

Any question please feel free to contact me!
